## Abstract

The study of patterns formations is a central issue in both biology and mathematics (Murray,1993). In this report, we focus on the pattern formation in a predator-prey model, especially the reaction-diffusion predator-prey model with Allee effect. We study whether the model can produce Turing patterns and use mathematical methods to obtain the results. We also use some computational tools to draw images.

At the beginning, we give a brief interview on the basic knowledge, then we analyse the PDEs (partial differential equation). Specifically, we present two PDEs to simulate the dynamics of predator-prey (mainly from the population density perspective), and use the analytical method to determine the conditions under which the Turing instability arises. After establishing the conditions for Turing instability, we utilize MATLAB to visualize the results. We conclude the paper by discussing the significance of the Allee constant, and analyzing various scenarios in detail.
